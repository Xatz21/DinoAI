Teaching AI to play Dino.

This is another project that showcases the NEAT(NeuroEvoluton of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm.
In this case we train AI to play the classic dino game jumping through cacti, making it as far as possible.
NEAT evolves neural networks to enhance their performance across generations, demonstrating the power of evolutionary algorithms in solving complex tasks.
